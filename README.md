# mruby-process <br> [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/appPlant/mruby-process.svg?branch=windows)](https://travis-ci.org/appPlant/mruby-process) [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/1uu04u7wtbup1oqk/branch/windows?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/katzer/mruby-process/branch/windows) [![codebeat badge](https://codebeat.co/badges/02e9d761-e8b6-4939-9ef2-b88fd0c93a84)](https://codebeat.co/projects/github-com-appplant-mruby-process-windows)

Implementation of the Ruby 2.4.1 Core Library _Process_ for [mruby][mruby].

All listed methods have been tested with Ubuntu, MacOS and Windows. Cross compilation works as well.

```ruby
system { VAR: 'var' }, 'echo $VAR', out: pipe
```

Include [mruby/ext/process.h][process_h] to use the native methods within your own project:

```c
// To use kill, waitpid, fork, spawn, ... on Unix and Win32

#ifdef HAVE_MRB_PROCESS_H
# include "mruby/ext/process.h"
#endif

static pid_t
spawn_process(const char *path, char *const argv[], char *const envp[])
{
    return spawnve(path, argv, envp);
}
```

## Installation

Add the line below to your `build_config.rb`:

```ruby
MRuby::Build.new do |conf|
  # ... (snip) ...
  conf.gem 'mruby-process'
end
```

Or add this line to your aplication's `mrbgem.rake`:

```ruby
MRuby::Gem::Specification.new('your-mrbgem') do |spec|
  # ... (snip) ...
  spec.add_dependency 'mruby-process'
end
```

### Signal

## Development

Clone the repo:
    
    $ git clone https://github.com/appplant/mruby-process.git && cd mruby-process/

Compile the source:

    $ rake compile

Run the tests:

    $ rake test


## Caveats

 - $? may not work correctly on the platform where ``pid_t`` is not ``int`` or
   ``MRB_INT_MAX`` is less than ``PID_MAX`` (or /proc/sys/kernel/pid_max).
